# LayoutGKN: Graph Similarity Learning of Floor Plans

The code accompanies the paper [LayoutGKN: Graph Similarity Learning of Floor Plans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03737), to appear in [BMVC 2025](https://bmvc2025.bmva.org/).

**Abstract** -
Floor plans depict building layouts and are often represented as graphs to capture the underlying spatial relationships. 
Comparison of these graphs is critical for applications like search, clustering, and data visualization. 
The most successful methods to compare graphs i.e., graph matching networks, rely on costly intermediate cross-graph node-level interactions, therefore being slow in inference time. 
We introduce **LayoutGKN**, a more efficient approach that postpones the cross-graph node-level interactions to the end of the joint embedding architecture. 
We do so by using a differentiable graph kernel as a distance function on the final learned node-level embeddings. 
We show that LayoutGKN computes similarity comparably or better than graph matching networks while significantly increasing the speed.

## üõ†

It is a work-in-progress repository.
Few elements are missing still and I think that here and there extra explanations could help a lot in understanding the code and how to use it (eg, by adding notebooks).
The following will be added before the start of the conference in Sheffield:

- [ ] `.py` Script for evaluation
- [ ] `.py` Script for generating the triplets
- [ ] `.ipynb` Notebook on training and evaluation
- [ ] `.ipynb` Notebook on visualizing the data, running models for retrieval, and making cool and informative 2D search maps using tSNE.
- [ ] üö© Add properly trained model checkpoints to `models/`
- [ ] üîç Add explanation on floor plan graph definition and formats to `README.md`: `networkx` and `pytorch geometric` packages; node-, edge-, and graph-level attributes; graph triplets.

Nonetheless, the repo including publicly available preprocessed data (see section `Data` below) should be enough to train your own models!

## Usage

For installation, first clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/caspervanengelenburg/LayoutGKN.git
cd LayoutGKN
```

And install it using `uv`:
```bash
uv pip install .
```

And install Pytorch Geometric (PyG) using a correct wheel, for instance PyTorch 2.8 with CUDA 12.8:

```bash
 uv pip install torch-geometric torch-scatter torch-sparse torch-cluster torch-spline-conv pyg-lib \
    --find-links https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.8.0+cu128.html
```

Note that not all "pairings" between PyTorch and PyG exist.
For more details, see the [PyG Docs on Installation](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/installation.html).
Btw, they have great tutorials on graph machine learning and processing.

## Data

The preprocessed RPLAN data (*i.e.*, the graphs and triplets) can be downloaded from our [public drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1eS91rwmkw6s74bPcpl_PbgsoOvaQzseQ).
Using this data in your project?
Make sure to *always* cite the [RPLAN paper](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~fuxm/projects/DeepLayout/index.html).

You can also produce the graphs yourself from the original images.
First [download the RPLAN dataset by filling in the survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfwteilXzURRKDI5QopWCyOGkeb_CFFbRwtQ0SOPhEg0KGSfw/viewform).
If they accept your request, you will receive an email with the download link.
Second, create a subfolder within `data/rplan`, for instance `original`, to store the images and change the default config (`confg/default.yaml`) accordingly, simply by changing the key `path_rplan`.
Third you run the preprocessing script:

```bash
python -m scripts.rplan_to_graph.run --path_rplan=PATH/TO/RPLAN/IMAGES --path_data=PATH/TO/RPLAN/GRAPHS
```

If your folders align with the default config (`conf/default.yaml`), you don't have to specify the paths in the terminal.

## Training and evaluation

For running a single training run + (optionally) log to W&B:
```bash
python -m scripts.run --lr=1e-4 --num_layers=4  # etc. see cfg.yaml
```
